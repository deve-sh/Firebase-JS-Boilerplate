# Firebase JavaScript Boilerplate

Small Code Snippets useful for the two variants of the Firebase SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Index

#### v8 SDK

The v8 SDK is the side-effect based SDK, i.e: All the functionality you need will be bundled in one single export and will be imported.

A Pro of this SDK is that it's simpler to use and everything that's needed is simpler to find and replicate from the docs, but then the con is that it's bulkier since you're importing everything, even stuff you don't need.
